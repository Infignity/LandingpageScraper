Ça m’a inspiré confiance car beaucoup de sites/revendeurs proposent des scobys dont on ne sait pas dans quelles conditions ils ont été cultivés. En plus j’ai eu la chance de pouvoir aller rechercher mon scoby directement dans leurs ateliers de production: tout est hyper clean, c’est un vrai laboratoire de chimie, les frigos sont rangés, tout est étiqueté.

Étant une très grande fan et fascinée par ces incroyable boissons que sont le kombucha et le kéfir, j’ai acheté un pack kéfir + un scoby (kombucha). J’ai montré à ma mère la culture du kéfir à qui je l’ai offert et ai gardé pour moi le kombucha ! J’ai eu beaucoup de questions concernant la culture de ces deux êtres vivants et continue à en avoir au fil de ma découverte et pratique, mais Orisae a toujours pris le temps de répondre à toutes celles-ci ! Je recommande aveuglément et à 100% !

        "landingPageText": "Subscribe Free.Ultraviolet (UV) light has been used for many decades to destroy disease-causing pathogens in drinking water. This chemical-free technology is most commonly deployed against such pathogens asE.coliand Coliform that can easily contaminate well and surface waters.Wyckomar manufactures UV systems for almost any flow rate from residential to commercial/industrial. You can choose from our standard line-up of UV purifiers or we can build to your project specifications.The importance and practical use of UV Air disinfection has been brought to light by the pandemic. Airborne pathogens including virus and bacteria are destroyed by germicidal UV light at 254nm and you can use our UV-Air systems to help reduce viral loads in almost any room. Wyckomar has two models of UV-Air purifiers to suit your needs for commercial and institutional use.Making drinking water safe is different from what we commonly think of as simple filtration. Where filtration involves physically removing contaminants such as rust and dirt from a water source, the UV process works by acting on unseen pathogens in the water, many of which can be harmful to health.UV disinfection is the process of killing pathogens in the water supply. These includeInfluenza,E. coli, Coliform, Hepatitis,V. cholerae,Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Legionellaand many more. (See comprehensiveUV Inactivation Chart.) UV is highly effective against all common bacterial, viral and cyst types of pathogen.A UV system kills these pathogens instantly by exposing the water stream to a high intensity UV light, much like the sun. This process uses no chemicals and is completely neutral. After this brief exposure, no pathogens survive and the water is safe to drink..When combined with proper filtration, theUV disinfection processwill provide you with unlimited amounts of clean, safe and pathogen-free water for use throughout the entire home.Read up on the various challenges and solutions for drinking water treatment and disinfection.Did you know that germicidal UV is effective against virus and bacteria circulating in the air? Now you can take the next step to building your defences against the virus by using upper-room germicidal UV air disinfection by Wyckomar.Our UV-Air products act as the Silent Sentry in your home or workplace to help reduce the viral and bacterial load in the air.We have more than 40 years of experience in the UV Disinfection industry and our products are made in Canada.Build your defences.More Info.The Solar Tote by Wyckomar is a complete portable solar-powered water treatment system plus a lot more.The Solar Tote is also a stand-alone electrical power center allowing you to operate a wide variety of 12VDC devices and when equipped with an invertor you can also run some 120/240V appliances.The system is fully independent and very useful for black-out and other emergency conditions.More Info.Copyright © Wyckomar Inc. 2022Privacy Policysitemap",

Love it .  Would highly recommend. If you have not tried this yet you should  you wont be disappointed.A little bit of happiness every day. I always look forward to having my sachet of flower essence each day. It's a beautiful, delicious & uplifting way to connect with nature each day, even in the colder months. I have been really enjoying the happiness pack & will look forward to purchasing more.These sachets are easy enough to use and taste okay (not a very strong taste at all), but they make the texture of the water feel a little oily and unpleasant.this is the best  product i have found and im still using it . Have tried others but this is the best hands down . Love it . I have them to suit my mood. Would highly recommend . No nasty after taste unlike the others. Been using this since they started and although i don't purchase them as much as i used to i will be now.I received the variety pack as a gift for Christmas and found it really helped me to drink more water as I get so bored of it though know I need to drink much more to keep healthy! I found it really worked so I recently decided to buy myself another pack and went for the variety pack again because I enjoyed trying the different flavours - they're all so good so I couldn't possibly choose so didn't want to stick to just one flavour!",

Inaugurated one year ago, Imerys’ state-of-the-art calcium aluminate plant in Vizag, Andhra Pradesh, in India’s southeastern coastal region, produces new products that answer this precise need. It recently showcased its products and initiatives during a construction workshop for customers on October 16 in Mumbai.Held in Frankfurt this year, the Unified International Technical Conference on Refractories (UNITECR) is the largest and most important conference for the refractories market. Imerys teams were present to set out their latest research and solutions for the refractories market and share Imerys’ wider sustainability product assessment methodology, SustainAgility.With the construction of a new onsite energy recovery plant, Imerys is capturing the feedstock energy contained in syngas, a by-product generated during the carbon black manufacturing. The project – a partnership with energy supplier E.On – will significantly reduce the environmental footprint of carbon black – a key additive  in lithium ion batteries serving the clean energy transition.The unification of the three previous laboratories aims to increase efficiency and shorten project deadlines by speeding up the interaction between the different functions and applications of minerals in various industries.....Imerys S.A. - 43 Quai de Grenelle, 75015 ParisTel: +33 1 49 55 63 00",

However, long pipelines caused contamination leading to widespread diseases. Gradually low-cost filtering methods were introduced, which eventually replaced aqueducts.

These systems work by removing calcium and magnesium ions from the water, which causes hardness. The water softening process involves the exchange of these ions with sodium ions, making the water soft and more suitable for household use. This results in an improvement in the taste of the water andprevents scaling in appliances. Investing in a reliable water softening system can significantly improve your household’s water quality.Apart from improving the quality of water, water softening systems alsoprotect household appliances from scaling caused by hard water. Devices such as dishwashers and washing machines are prone to scaling, significantly reducing their lifespan.

In addition, soft water requires less detergent and cleaning products, making it more environmentally friendly.Another benefit of water softeners isbetter skin and hair health.

We are unable to ship to Hawaii or Alaska at this time.From the time the order was placed until it showed up at the front door was literally less than 24 hrs!!!.The next day the system was placed in service. It took only a couple leisurely hours to install and within minutes there was a noticeable difference in water quality!!.I can’t believe I waited so long to do this!!.Only after one day I have already recommended this system to many coworkers and friends!!.Thanks for a great product!!.I have been buying bags of 40lb water softener for years, lugging that in and out of my garage, and buying bottle water because we were only treating our water with salt pellets. I compared Kind Water Systems to other systems on the market and found the quality and price to be far more superiorthan other systems. With that said, I decided to put it to the test. First, the website is very user friendly and easy to navigate (5 stars), 2nd the customer service and their ability to answer all of my questions (and I had a lot) was amazing (5 stars). 3rd I received a shipping notification within 48 hours of purchasing the product on line (5 stars). 4th I received the product 48 hours later (so approximately 4 days from purchase) which is unheard of in this economy (5 stars). 5th – my plumber was able to install the new system and remove my ancient salt softener system in just a matter of a couple of hours (5 stars). And most importantly, our water flowing through our entire house is now perfect to drink and shower with (5 stars)! No more bottle water, no more 40lbs of water softener! Both my wife and daughter said they love the way it makes their hair feel when they shower too (10 stars). It also created more space in my garage since it mounts on the wall (see photo) (5 stars). I signed up for the automatic annual filter order service they offer because I’ll never remember to do that on my own (5 stars). I do not normally leave Google reviews but felt compelled to with this product. I’d probably give it more than 5 stars if I could! I hope the company produces one for RV’s next! I’d buy that in a heartbeat and give it 10 stars too!.Its nice to get a human on the phone quickly.called with install questions twice and both times got quick knowledgeable advice.

Waterreserves zijn aan het uitputten, terwijl overvloedige neerslag veel schade aanbrengt.Bedrijven leggen zichzelf nu concrete doelstellingen op voor energie, CO2én watergebruik. Ekopak wil die bedrijven helpen om het tij te keren. Door volop in te zetten op innovatieve technologie voor waterrecyclage..Fabrieken gebruiken vandaag miljarden liters drinkwater per uur. Dat wordt achteraf behandeld in een biologische waterzuivering, waarna het afvalwater geloosd wordt in beken en rivieren. Het stroomt naar de zee en je bent het kwijt. Ontziltingsinstallaties verbruiken tonnen energie om het water opnieuw landinwaarts te pompen. Dat is niet futureproof.Bedrijven – vooral in waterintensieve sectoren zoals voeding, textiel, farma, chemie – worden gedwongen een duurzame oplossing te vinden. Ze lopen het risico voor een blue-out te staan: het risico op kritieke momenten zonder water te zitten. Ekopak biedt concrete oplossingen aan om waterverbruik te reduceren, afvalwater te zuiveren en te recycleren tot ultrapuur water. We noemen dat duurzame proces ’Reduce. Reuse. Revalue.’ Het leidt tot een constante beschikbaarheid van water, levensbelangrijk voor veel bedrijven.Bij Ekopak geloven we dat we als bedrijf een verantwoordelijkheid hebben tegenover onze medewerkers, onze maatschappij en onze planeet. We erven de planeet niet van onze ouders, we lenen ze van onze kinderen.Dankzij Ekopak staan bedrijven sterker als het gaat over Environmental, Social en Governance (Milieu, Maatschappij en Governance). We werken onder meer samen met de wereldwijde organisatieWater.org.Ekopak wil als beursgenoteerd bedrijf een vooraanstaande rol spelen in de recyclage en herwaardering van water. We bieden onze knowhow en oplossingen internationaal aan, want de hele wereld heeft rationeel watergebruik nodig.Water-as-a-Service (WaaS) is een service op maat van bedrijven. Ze krijgen de zekerheid dat er permanent water is van optimale kwaliteit én geproduceerd op een duurzame manier. Dat garanderen we door innovatieve technologie en alternatieve waterbronnen ter plaatse bij hen te combineren. De kostprijs ligt lager dan bij conventionele watervoorziening. Bovendien betalen ze voor Water-as-a-Service (WaaS) alleen maar het waterverbruik per liter. WaaS ontzorgt onze klanten totaal.We kunnen bij Ekopak onze verantwoordelijkheid alleen maar nemen en waarmaken als we over de juiste technieken beschikken. Daarom hebben we voortdurend oog voor technologische innovatie. Onze ingenieurs analyseren bij klanten elk project afzonderlijk en ontwikkelen een oplossing en service op maat. Ervaren technische teams installeren de apparatuur ter plaatse. Deze geïntegreerde werkwijze zorgt voor duurzame en kosteneffectieve oplossingen. Dankzij een constante monitoring en uitgebreide support houden we de bedrijfszekerheid ervan 24/7 op peil.Door het gebruik van water als koelmiddel zijn industriële koelsystemen gevoelig aan corrosie en afzettingen.Door verhoogde druk en temperatuur zijn stoomketels en warmwatersystemen gevoelig aan corrosie en afzettingen.Of het nu gaat om koelvloeistof, procesmiddel, oplosmiddel of vervoermiddel, ongeveer elk bedrijf gebruikt water.Afgezien van de esthetische schade en directe kosten, leidt corrosie tot enorme functionele- en productieverliezen.Ultrafiltratie is een techniek waarmee je bacteriën en virussen uit het water haalt.Water kan ervoor zorgen dat drinkwater en leidingwater besmet geraken met de Legionella bacterie.Water is kostbaar en cruciaal. Het is de drijvende kracht achter de hele natuur, in het dagelijkse leven, en ook in de sport. Wielrenners kunnen bijvoorbeeld niet presteren zonder waterbevoorrading.

Circulair.Lozen van afvalwater wordt steeds duurder vanwege de strenge eisen voor waterkwaliteit. Ook de kosten van het afvoeren van sludge nemen toe.Voor het zuiveren van afvalwater heb je chemicaliën of toepassingen nodig die schadelijk zijn of veel energie verbruiken.Traditionele waterzuiveringsprocessen zijn veelomvattend. De benodigde chemicaliën vervullen vaak slechts één taak in het proces, waardoor veel stappen nodig zijn.Als industrieel bedrijf gebruik je veel water. Het zuiveringsproces is erop gericht om het water zonder schadelijke stoffen te lozen in plaats van te hergebruiken.Ferraat(VI) is ontzettend krachtig èn milieuvriendelijk. Het vervangt traditionele chemicaliën die lastig te verwijderen zijn uit het water en meer energie verbruiken. Het is de beste manier om te verduurzamen.Ferraat(VI) heeft een veelzijdige werking: het is de sterkste oxidant ter wereld, het reageert met opgeloste stoffen zodat zij bezinken en als neveneffect elimineert het sommige bacteriën, schimmels en virussen.Ferraat(VI) maakt restwater zo puur dat een groot deel teruggebracht kan worden in jouw proces. Soms is zelfs de sludge als grondstof te hergebruiken. Het restwater hoeft niet meer geloosd te worden en zo draag je bij aan de circulaire watereconomie.Ferraat(VI) maakt het zuiveren van water groen, efficiënt en circulair. Water wordt zo zuiver dat het grotendeels opnieuw ingezet kan worden in jouw proces. Dankzij de zeer krachtige oxiderende werking blijft veel minder sludge over, die bovendien veel compacter is.Door je water te zuiveren met Ferraat(VI) bespaar je veel energie. Dit komt onder andere doordat minder processtappen nodig zijn, RO systemen efficiënter blijven werken, minder sludge overblijft en soms lagere temperaturen nodig zijn voor de zuivering. Zo maakt Ferraat(VI) jouw industriële proces groener.Verwijder pesticiden volledig.Reduceer energieverbruik.Reduceer fosfaat met 90%.Voldoe aan waterproof 2027.Gebruik water circulair.Verbeter werking RO systeem.Verminder chemicaliën.Verhoog groene ambities.Loos minder water.Verbeter werking RO systeem.Reduceer energieverbruik.Reduceer sludge.Verhoog groene ambities.Reduceer energieverbruik.Gebruik water circulair.Verbeter werking RO systeem.Reduceer sludge met 80%.Verminder chemicaliën.Versimpel het proces.Injecteer minder water.Verminder chemicaliën.Reductie energieverbruik.Gebruik water circulair.Verhoog groene ambities.Verwijder microverontreiniging.Reduceer kosten en oppervlakte.Reduceer fosfaat met 99%.Verminder chemicaliën.Optimaliseer biologische waterzuivering.Reduceer sludge.ATP reductie van 858 RLU naar 55 RLU.“.Vind de oplossing voor jouw afvalwater en laat het door ons behandelen met FerSol® -Ferraat(VI) in vloeibare vorm- in het Ferr-Tech waterlab. Wij onderzoeken met welke verontreinigingen je te maken hebt om te bepalen op welke manier FerSol® jouw proces verbetert.Hierdoor krijg je inzicht in hoe FerSol® jouw waterzuivering groen, efficiënt en circulair maakt. Bovendien kun je ook andere uitdagingen bespreken op het gebied van waterzuivering. We worden graag uitgedaagd!.Geef ons een sample van je meest vervuilde afvalwater. Wij behandelen het water met FerSol® en werken toe naar een oplossing.Op basis van de analyse doen wij een voorstel voor een groen, efficiënt en circulair waterproces.Tenslotte laten we zien hoe je FerSol® eenvoudig kunt toepassen in jouw huidige zuiveringssysteem.Ferraat(VI) staat al decennia wereldwijd bekend als de sterkste oxidant voor waterbehandeling van (industrieel) afvalwater. In tegenstelling tot veelgebruikte chemicaliën voor waterzuivering, is Ferraat(VI) milieuvriendelijk.Tot op heden was het niet mogelijk om Ferraat(VI) stabiel en houdbaar te produceren. Met baanbrekend onderzoek van onze oprichters, en inmiddels een uniek en gepatenteerd productieproces, kunnen wij Ferraat(VI) stabiel en houdbaar aanbieden voor industrieel gebruik. Wij zijn als Drentse startup wereldwijd de eerste onderneming die hierin geslaagd is.Wanneer je Ferraat(VI) inzet voor de zuivering van jouw afvalwater, maak je jouw proces duurzamer, energiezuiniger en ben je in staat om water circulair in te zetten voor je industriële proces. Neem deel aan de groene industriële revolutie en reinig je afvalwater groen, efficiënt en circulair met Ferraat(VI).Necessary cookies are absolutely essential for the website to function properly.

Filtriranje nečistoč s filtri se dogaja povsod okoli nas, predvsem v industriji.Tudi doma je filtriranje pogosta zadeva, pomislite na filter v sesalcu, prezračevalnem sistemu, klima napravi ali na filtriranje pitne vode. Neke vrste filtracija se zgodi že, ko stresemo testenine iz lonca v cedilo. Tudi vsakič, ko zaženemo naš jeklen konjiček, je prva stvar v avtu filtracija zraka, ki ga motor potegne vase preko zračnega filtra. Tudi vsi ostali filtri gredo nato takoj v delo, saj poteka nato še konstantno filtriranje goriva, motornega olja in zraka za prezračevanje kabine. Delci in nečistočeniso dobrodošle na veliko področjih, s filtri pa jih učinkovito odstranimo. V naše filtre ujamemo tako grobe kot fine delce nečistoč. Delci so lahko mikroskopsko majhni ali pa vidni tudi s prostim očesom.Filtracija nas tako spremlja na vsakem koraku, če se zavedamo ali ne. In vsako filtriranje pripomore k izboljšanju nečesa kot je zrak, ki ga vdihavamo, vode v našem okolju in ostalo odstranjevanje nečistoč.Poslanstvo podjetja Prima Filtertehnika je filtracija najrazličnejših medijev v industrijskih panogah, kot so proizvodna industrija, gradbeništvo, živilska industrija, farmacija, prevozništvo in še mnogo več. Vsem je skupnatočka tudi filtriranje raznih medijev kot so olje, tako motorno kot hidravlično, gorivo, zrak, najrazličnejše tekočine in plini… Znebite se nečistoč z našimi kvalitetnimi filtri!.Več o filtraciji in filtrih za različne namene najdete na naših podstraneh, za RES še več pa nas kar kontaktirajte..Izkušeni v filtraciji.

Through meticulous and reliable work, our company has become known as a top Engineering and  Equipment Manufacturer.The selection of products manufactured by BEAUDREY are not only of the highest quality but are also available in a variety of options to ensure you find exactly what you’re looking for. With top-of-the-line materials, cutting-edge production technologies and a highly qualified team, we guarantee complete satisfaction.Water screening consists in separating debris or either natural or man-made origin, from the water itself. A successful screening plant must be carefully designed and built according to the quality of debris to be removed. The screening equipment must be of a high standard of efficiency and reliability.All BEAUDREY screening plants are custom-built and with over 100 years of experience our machines, designed to minimize operational costs and maintenance needs, are an efficient and economical solution to all water-screening problems.The efficiency of a condenser is strictly proportional to the heat-transfer of the tube walls. Condenser fouling decreases plant efficiency. BEAUDREY tube-cleaning systems keep the inner face of the tubes clean and are your solution to increasing the generated power of your plant.When mechanically filtering water, incoming water carries a good deal of water-life (fish, eggs, larvae, crustaceans, eels, etc.). Since 1980, BEAUDREY has been involved in developing solutions to protect these lifeforms and return them unharmed into their natural environment.

Dafür haben wir unterschiedlichste, kreative Installationenzur Wasserveredelungentwickelt und realisiert. Sieh dir unten eine Auswahl unserer Freunde an und erfahre mehr über unsere Projekte. Ob Fitnessstudio, Brauerei oder im Büro – LEOGANT Wasser ist Teil einer besonderen Community.Seit 2009 vereinen wir Premium Aktivkohlefilter mit wirksamer Vitalisierungstechnologie zu ganzheitlichen Filtersystemen. Schadstoffe wie beispielsweise Medikamente, Schwermetalle oder Bakterien werden sicher entfernt. Gleichzeitig bleiben bei der Filterung mit unseren natürlichen Wasserfiltern Minerale und Spurenelemente im Wasser enthalten. Natürlicher Wassergenuss wie aus einer reinen Quelle in den Bergen. Unsere ganzheitlichen Konzeptezur Wasserveredelungmachen einen Unterschied, den man spürt und vor allem schmeckt.Werden Hormone, Medikamente, Schwermetalle und Mikroplastik gefiltert?.Ja. Unsere mehrfach getestete deutsche Aktivkohle-Patrone ist TÜV-geprüft und entfernt sicher unerwünschte Rückstände und Schadstoffe wie:.Hormone.Medikamente.Pestizide.Mikroplastik.Parasiten.Blei.Kupfer.Chlor.Chemische und organische Rückstände.Mehr dazu findest du in unseren Untersuchungen.Verändert sich der TDS/Mikrosimens-Wert durch einen LEOGANT Filter?.Nein. Der TDS-Wert/µs-Wert kann keine Aussage darüber treffen, ob ein Wasser gesund ist oder nicht. Alleine die Leitfähigkeit wird hier gemessen. Unser Ansatz ist eine naturnahe Wasseraufbereitung, daher bleiben Mineralien und Spurenelemente im Wasser unverändert. Ein Wasser mit vielen Mineralien hat einen höheren TDS-Wert/µs-Wert im Gegensatz zu einem Wasser mit wenigen Mineralien. In der Natur kommen Quellwässer, abhängig von ihrem Ursprung, in unterschiedlicher Mineralkonzentration, beispielsweise Calcium, Kalium, Magnesium und Natrium, vor. Daher ist der TDS-Wert/µs-Wert abhängig von der Region, in der du wohnst.Mehr dazu erfährst du hier.Bietet LEOGANT eine Geld-zurück-Garantie?.Wir bei LEOGANT sind absolut überzeugt von der Qualität und Leistung unserer Wasserfilter. Deshalb möchten wir, dass Du diese Begeisterung mit uns teilst. Wir sind uns sicher, dass auch Du das Wasser lieben wirst. Und das nicht nur für einen Moment, sondern über viele Jahre hinweg! Die positive Resonanz unserer Kunden bestätigt unsere Qualität und den unvergleichlichen Geschmack des LEOGANT-Wassers.Aus diesem Grund bieten wir eine 4-wöchige Geld-zurück-Garantie an. Probiere es aus, trinke das Wasser, fühle den Unterschied und komm in unsere Community der Wasserfans.Ist für das Filtersystem ein spezieller Wasserhahn notwendig?.Unsere Filtersysteme erfordern meistens spezielle Wasserhähne. Eine Ausnahme bildet unser Auftischfilter AVAIO, der direkt an deinen bestehenden Wasserhahn angeschlossen wird. Für Systeme, die nur stilles Wasser liefern, kannst du zwischen 3-Wege-Armaturen wählen, die deine aktuelle Armatur ersetzen, oder einer separaten Armatur, für die allerdings ein zusätzliches Loch benötigt wird. Die speziellen Trinkwasserarmaturen sorgen für Komfort und Hygiene, indem sie gefiltertes und normales Brauchwasser trennen und somit keine Schadstoffe wieder in das Wasser gelangen können. Mit unserem Premium-Filter, der 4 Liter Durchfluss pro Minute schafft, kann in Einzelfällen auch das gesamte Kaltwasser gefiltert werden, wenn du dich nicht von deiner Armatur trennen kannst. Für Systeme mit kochendem Wasser oder Sprudelfunktion ist eine spezielle Armatur allerdings unabdingbar, da sie die Geräte elektronisch steuert.Wird Kalk auch gefiltert?.Nein. Ein LEOGANT Filter-System ist darauf ausgelegt das natürliche Gleichgewicht des Wassers wieder herzustellen. Minerale und Spurenelemente bleiben bei unserem Filtersystem im Wasser enthalten - auch der gelöste Kalk (Calciumcarbonat). Gelöste Mineralien können verstoffwechselt werden und geben dem Wasser seinen regional typischen Geschmack und stabilisieren den PH-Wert.Kalk hat im Trinkwasser verschiedene Funktionen wie:.Mineralquelle: Kalk liefert Calcium.Geschmack: Kalk ist ein wichtiger Geschmacksträger.Neutralisation von Säuren: Kalk ist alkalisch.Durch unsere Vitalisierung wird der Kalk im Wasser in seiner geometrischen Struktur jedoch verändert, so dass er nicht mehr so stark anhaftet und das Wasser schmeckt frisch und weich.Mehr dazu erfährst du hier.Wie hoch sind die Folgekosten?.Nach DIN EN 806 muss ein Wasserfilter spätestens nach 6 Monaten gewechselt werden. Daher benötigst du für unsere Standard-Filtersysteme 2 Filterpatronen pro Jahr.Eine Filterpatrone kostet 129,- Euro. Die Folgekosten belaufen sich also auf 258,- Euro pro Jahr für bis zu 40.000 Liter Wasser.Unsere Business Konzepte für z.B. größeren Produktionen, Fitness Studios oder die Gastronomie können bis zu 4 Filterpatronen enthalten und die jährlichen Kosten sind entsprechend höher.Wie umweltfreundlich ist ein LEOGANT Filtersystem?.LEOGANT steht für Nachhaltigkeit und Qualität. Unsere Filtersysteme sind nicht nur hervorragend verarbeitet, sondern auch auf Langlebigkeit ausgelegt. Viele unserer Kunden verwenden unsere Produkte seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt. Beim Filterwechsel muss nur die Aktivkohlepatrone ausgetauscht werden und nicht, wie bei vielen anderen Anbietern, das gesamte Gehäuse. Die Aktivkohlepatrone besteht aus Kokosnussschalen, einem nachwachsenden Rohstoff. Die Filtersysteme selbst funktionieren ohne Strom (außer Wasserkocher und Sprudelgeräte) und es wird kein Abwasser beim Filtern verschwendet. So minimieren wir Abfall und schonen die Umwelt. Wenn du dich für LEOGANT entscheidest, investierst du nicht nur in ein langlebiges Produkt und exzellentes Wasser, sondern auch in ein CO2- und plastikneutrales Unternehmen, das Umweltschutz in seiner DNA hat. Und natürlich sorgst du für weniger Müll und weniger Wasserflaschen, wenn du ein LEOGANT Filtersystem nutzt.Kann ich das Filtersystem selber installieren oder bietet LEOGANT einen Installationsservice an?.Wir bieten deutschlandweit einen Installationsservice an, um sicherzustellen, dass dein LEOGANT Filtersystem korrekt und hygienisch installiert wird. Falls du die Installation selbst durchführen möchtest, liefern wir unsere Systeme mit allem erforderlichen Anschlussmaterial und Installationshinweisen. Beachte dabei aber, dass je nach System unterschiedliche handwerkliche Fähigkeiten erforderlich sind. Während du kleinere Installationen im privaten Bereich zwar durchführen kannst, bitten wir dich gerade beim Trinkwasser auf Hygiene und Trinkwasserschutz zu achten. Prüfe stets ein paar Tage nach der Installation, ob wirklich alles dicht ist. Eigenständig durchgeführte Installationen sind von unserer Haftung ausgeschlossen, daher empfehlen wir Laien unbedingt, einen Techniker zu beauftragen. Für professionelle Anwendungen ist ein zertifizierter Techniker generell erforderlich.Unsere Mission ist der bewusste Umgang mit dem Element Wasser. Dies beginnt bei unserer natürlichen Wasseraufbereitung und -veredelung und setzt sich bei der Nachhaltigkeit fort: Wir wollen den Müll an Wasserflaschen, Plastik und Schadstoffen in der Umwelt zu reduzieren.

We will provide all the advice and assistance you require during planning.Is your GEH® system working smoothly? Or are there still optimisation possibilities, malfunctions to be prevented, costs to be reduced and can the operational safety be increased?.In 2010, the UN made access to clean water a human right. At GEH Wasserchemie, however, we have already been working on creating effective and sustainable water treatment since 1997. Our goal is to provide clean water to people across the globe.This is what motivated us to invent the patented iron-hydroxide based adsorption material. We now produce 1,500 tonnes annually, supplying customers worldwide.Our material is more effective compared to that of our competitors. Comparative tests clearly verified higher treatment capacities of up to 100 percent. Good for our customers: When they use GEH®, their systems achieve a far longer life span with the same expenditure of material.With its EN DIN 15029 standard, the EU sets the quality standards for iron-hydroxide used in the treatment of drinking water. And we don’t just meet these standards. We exceed them - and raise the bar even higher.Chromium.All information relating to concentrations is based on the dry weight.The big advantage offered by our adsorbent material is its sustainability: in contrast to processes using precipitant agents and subsequent filtration, our product effectively binds heavy metals and removes them from the water cycle once and for all. The waste volumes are lower when GEH®is used..In our everyday business, the protection of the environment is always an issue, whether it is the treatment of drinking water or the purification of wastewater. However, the production of our adsorption media also has an impact on the environment. Therefore, we have been operating an environmental management system for several years in order to avoid harmful effects of our operational processes..After many congresses and trade fairs had to be cancelled or could only be organized online in recent years due to the Corona epidemic, one of the most important events in the water sector took place again this late summer: The International Water Association (IWA) hosted the World Water Congress & Exhibition in Copenhagen, Denmark, from 11 to 15 September 2022..In July of this year, a workshop on „water treatment and water recycling in India“ took place in Hamburg. Our Head of R&D Carsten Bahr was there to discuss the challenges with German and Indian experts. In addition to many other issues like water recycling, the removal of arsenic from groundwater to produce drinking water is an important concern in India. Arsenic-contaminated water is still a major problem for the population, particularly in rural areas..M.Sc.

This is according\n                            to the Hydration Foundation, a leading research organization focused on cellular hydration.\n                            At Spring Aqua, our goal is to give your body water that is clean, hydrating, and\n                            life-promoting.There are several world-famous mountain springs that attract millions of people annually\n                            because of the healing properties of the water. The Netflix documentary Down to Earth\n                            features Zac Efron and Darin Olien’s visit to Lourdes Springs in France. Lourdes Springs is\n                            home to one of the most famous healing shrines in the world, it receives 4-6 million\n                            visitors a year. Many of the visitors seek cures they believe come from drinking or bathing\n                            in the water. Scientists have studied this spring water since the late 1800’s hoping to\n                            unlock the mysteries and documenting these miraculous results. Spring Aqua has developed our\n                            own version of Lourdes water through mimicking the rock layers, geology, and other\n                            properties outlined in scientific studies. As a result, we have created a complete water\n                            hydration technology that you can have right in your own home.

To maximize their efficiency, the plates inside the tanks need to be regularly cleaned. Nordic Water has developed an automated robot cleaner that ensures this task is completed frequently and safely.With Nordic Water, you can rely on a partner that has enjoyed a reputation as a pioneer in water treatment technology for over five decades. You can count on a partner that develops original ideas, unique technical solutions and market-leading products for the purification of drinking water, waste water and water for industrial use.At Nordic Water, we are passionate about what we do. We know how important it is. Many people take clean water for granted and assume there is an unlimited supply available. Unfortunately, that’s not true. In global terms, clean water is a scarce commodity. But it doesn’t have to be that way. If we look after the water we have in the best possible way, we can make sure there is enough for everyone.Since the company was founded in 1962, we have been striving to create the best filtration-based water purification systems on the market. Our wide range of products includes innovative and energy-efficient solutions for mechanical separation, sand filtration, disc filters, micro-filters and membrane filters that filter out particles of any size from 6 mm right down to 10 microns.With our world-leading products, we can offer you optimum sedimentation solutions no matter how much or how little space you have at your disposal. Our products are designed to purify water over a long period and, thanks to their combination of quality, flexibility and effectiveness, they are in high demand all over the world.With our process solutions, we can offer you end-to-end support for drinking water, waste water and industrial water treatment. We produce intelligence, cost-effective solutions based on one or several of our products that are combined to form a comprehensive treatment system.We offer ready-made and packaged solutions based on one or several of our industry-leading products. We can provide you with both complete, compact and energy-efficient waste water treatment plants and pre-assembled drinking water systems – designed to suit your particular requirements.Standards of drinking water quality vary all over the world, but at Nordic Water we always strive to meet the most stringent requirements. The growing global population is also increasingly driving up demands in terms of water treatment capacity and efficient use of space. Our products therefore offer you maximum effectiveness over a minimal area. What’s more, thanks to their durability, reliability and energy-efficiency, they do this for a low overall cost.Waste water varies from place to place, which is why we provide flexible products that offer you plenty of versatility in all areas of a waste water treatment plant. They are also efficient enough to cope with the challenges of the future as the global population grows, space becomes increasingly scarce and ever-stricter requirements are placed on us to ensure that we can maintain and improve the quality of the world’s lakes, seas and rivers.Our products for industrial applications are used across various industries both for raw water treatment and recirculating processed water and for waste water treatment. Thanks to a combination of effective, energy-efficient technology and compact, reliable design, we can offer you market-leading solutions for use in areas such as the food and steel industries, paper mills and airports.Our primary treatment products can often be used as a substitute for sedimentation. You can therefore save both space and money that would otherwise be spent on building a settling tank. The products are suitable for treatment plants or industrial applications and, thanks to their effective filters, you can achieve the same – or even better – results as you would with sedimentation.Nordic Water Products AB.Molndal, Sweden.Alfagatan 5.SE-431 49 Mölndal.Phone: + 46 31 748 54 00.Email: NordicWater.Info@sulzer.com.© 2023  Nordic Water Products.

        "landingPageText": "LifeSaver Mobile changes your company's culture of distracted driving by automatically detecting drives and blocking cell phone use without additional hardware. Prevent fleet distracted driving & protect drivers with our fleet distracted driving technology.We've seen a50% dropin annual fleet insurance claims after we started using LifeSaver. Our drivers are now fully aware that we take this seriously and we're all in this together.Our proactive approach to fleet safety with systems like LifeSaver has helped increase our productivity and has helpedlower our insurance premiums.It's easy to deploy, taking justminutes to have drivers up and running.It allows safety officers to see who's compliant and allows for driver productivity since navigation and hands-free calls are okay. Most importantly, LifeSaver can reduce distracted driving immediately.We didn't want any of our employees to be the cause of any personal pain or loss to themselves or to others in our communities. As we've seen all too many times, even a single distracted driving collision can have a devastating impact on many lives.LifeSaver runs silently in the phone's background and automatically detects driving around the clock or within the days and times of operation you define..You can establish LifeSaver hours of operation (days and times) across your entire fleet or by group, giving you the ultimate control for both company-issued phones and personal-owned phones.  For example, you may choose to have LifeSaver active 24/7 for corporate phones, but only active Monday through Friday, 8am-5pm for personal phones.  Our app will automatically switch to inactive once you're beyond the hours of operation for that phone.You can configure LifeSaver to send a Daily Digest email to any driver who has triggered a violation during the preceding day.  This feature ensures that your drivers adhere to your mobile policies without requiring constant follow-up from your safety officers.  Closed loop driver feedback makes the driver responsible for his or her actions.We use the most advanced native technologies available on both iPhone and Android to minimize battery usage.  In order to automatically detect driving, LifeSaver needs to run in the phone's background, which will use slightly more battery.  LifeSaver will keep your incremental battery usage to under 1% per hour for the most commonly used phones.LifeSaver is a low-effort solution for administrators and safety officers to manage.  Here are a couple examples:.Our product provides direct feedback to the drivers when violations are reported (Daily Digest) or when there are possible problems with the app (App Health Check).Through the daily and weekly exception reporting emails, it's easy to spot which members of the team may be having issues.  Once a trouble spot is identified, you can log into your fleet portal to get more detail in order to make the discussions more constructive..The LifeSaver app deploys instantly from the cloud to your drivers' phones.  No need for you to see the vehicle, the driver or the phone.  For larger fleets, we can load your drivers into your fleet portal in just a few hours.  Use your portal to trigger the SMS requests to install the app, all at your own pace.  LifeSaver can be deployed to hundreds of drivers in as little as one day.  It's that easy..Phone calls and voice commands are defaulted as allowable exceptions. The app can be configured by the portal to report all phone calls (frequency and duration), report phone calls that are not hands-free, and/or block phone calls..By enabling this feature, your drivers will hear a real-time audible warning from their phone for any posted speed limit violations and/or maximum speed violations.  The triggers and tolerance levels for each type of violation can be configured in the portal by the fleet/safety manager..Designed to keep your drivers productive, LifeSaver allows for hands-free calls and the use of navigation apps.  Drivers will quickly adjust their driving behavior to remain outside the phone's lock screen and (subject to corporate policy) to use voice commands when necessary.  Any attempt to circumvent this rule triggers a violation, impacting the driver's individual score and team score..This feature ensures that the LifeSaver app is running correctly on each driver's phone.  If an issue is identified, LifeSaver lets the driver know how to correct the problem without the fleet administrator getting involved..Visual and manual phone distraction is a major cause in the rise of rear-end collisions.  Once the vehicle reaches 10 mph, LifeSaver prevents and discourages phone screen use while driving.  When the vehicle comes to a stop, LifeSaver quickly unlocks to allow normal use of the phone.  LifeSaver motivates your drivers to keep their eyes on the road versus the phone..Unlike other distracted driving solutions, LifeSaver works without any companion hardware.  No need to purchase, install or maintain additional beacons, OBD2 dongles, or custom hardware for the windshield.  No hardware means you never have to see the vehicle … our app deploys over the air to your driver's phone.  LifeSaver is all about making it easy for you, your drivers, and your company.Pros:I like that it compiles a monthly score. I also like the ability to see if the app has been deleted from the device.Cons:I have heard complaints from drivers that the map is not always accessible when utilizing GPS. I also wish that you could see an easier unlock report. The unlocks are shown on a map of where the unlock occurred. While this is a great feature, I would also like to see a list option to easier see dates and time stamps.-Dana L.Capterra.Getapp.Software Advice.Advantage Asset Tracking.Amerisure.Aware360.Barcoding.Barcom.Blue Arrow Telematics.Envue Telematics.esquared.Geotab.Ivanti.Jamf.NorthernBI.RMJ Tech.Safety National.Soti.T-Mobile.UFG Insurance.USA Fleet Solutions.Verizon Connect.WCF Insurance.Zebra..We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.You can find out more about which cookies we are using or switch them off insettings.This website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.

Removing 99.99% of protozoa, bacteria AND virus, our water purifiers will provide you with clean safe drinking water instantly wherever you go. All of our water purifiers have FailSafe technology so once the filter service life has been fulfilled, no water will pass through. You can be sure of LifeSaver’s ultimate protection.Our range of portable water purification bottles include the LifeSaver Liberty™ – the world’s first and only portable water purifier which is a bottle with inline pump combined – and the original LifeSaver Bottle which has been saving lives for over 10 years and is available with 2 sizes of filters to purify up to 4,000 or 6,000 litres of clean safe drinking water.

Its 5 litre storage capacity is ideally suited for families or small groups whilst on camping trips or days out. It’s small enough to be transported or to be stored in a vehicle, or to be used as a water purifier in the home.Water is one of life’s essentials and safe drinking water is taken for granted when it is readily available through the tap in your home, or bottled in stores. The unfortunate reality is that there are numerous disastrous events which could jeopardise our supply of safe water at any time. We never know what emergencies will arise that could leave us in a situation where we have no access to clean water so emergency prepping should be a priority . Following a disaster such as a hurricane, flooding often occurs and as a result, virus can quickly spread. This means a basic water filter like those typically used for camping won’t give you the level of protection you need (read our blog for further details on filter vs purifier safety). All LifeSaver purifiers remove virus, bacteria and cysts. They do this without the need for chemicals or electricity. The emergency preparedness water filter products below are delivered in aluminium foil sealed packaging which extends the product’s shelf life to up to 10 years. That’s 10 years of peace of mind, knowing you and your family have a safe solution to purify water in emergency situations.

Testing your water is the first step to fresher, better-tasting water every day. Keep you and your family healthy by testing your water.Some dissolved solids, heavy metals, minerals, and other impurities cause odors or odd tastes, and in some cases can even affect your health. Even more importantly, some water additives and impurities, like arsenic, cause problems you can’t taste, see, or smell.Create a true home of wellness!.Is your water healthy? Find out today! Education is the first step to understanding the quality of your water. Our comprehensive water analysis is free and will reveal what level of contaminates are present in your family’s drinking water. Our water technicians can explain the results and help you understand if there are any long or short term health impacts from consuming your current water source.Levels as low as 0.2 to 0.3 ppm will usually cause brown or reddish staining of laundry and plumbing fixtures. The presence of iron bacteria in water supplies will often cause these symptoms at even lower levels.Solids refer to minerals, salts and metals dissolved in water. This includes anything present in the water other than pure water and suspended solids.Chlorine is the most common solution used for disinfecting water. Biological contamination has two forms, pathogenic and non-pathogenic. All water supplies should be tested for biological content prior to use and consumption.Causes stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, numbness in hands and feet, partial paralysis, and blindness. It can also cause damage to the skin, circulatory system, and increase the risk of cancer.High levels of nitrates in drinking water can make you sick. Nitrates in your well water can come from animal waste, septic systems, flooded sewers, water runoff, fertilizers and decaying plants.The higher the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water, the higher the turbidity levels are, and the cloudier the water appears. It may be clay and silt from shoreline erosion, bottom sediments, or organic debris from stream and wastewater discharge.Our Education Page is full of great information to help keep your home happy and healthy.

This will help reduce the risk of serious illnesses such as gastrointestinal diseases and cancers caused by these contaminants.Installing a good quality water filter system can save money in the long run since it requires very little maintenance and reduces the amount of bottled water purchased by households. It also helps reduce energy costs by eliminating the need for boiling or cooling down unfiltered tap water before drinking or using it for other purposes, such as cooking.Many households find that having a filtration system allows them to access clean and safe drinking water without worrying about boiling the tap water each time they want to drink it. This increases convenience and often makes it more enjoyable for people to get their daily recommended intake of fluids from an easily accessible source at home rather than buying bottled water every time they need it.Most single-use plastic bottles used for drinking end up in landfills or are incinerated; this has an enormous impact on our environment due to its contribution to global warming and pollution levels. A filtration system eliminates this waste and helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions from burning unnecessary plastic bottles that would otherwise be produced if people did not use a filtration system.Filtering systems can improve the taste of your tap water while still being affordable compared with buying bottled water all the time; because filtered tap water is free from pollutants and contamination, it tastes much better than regular tap water due to its lack of chemicals or impurities that may have been present before filtering takes place.Upgrade to WaterMart Water Filters Today!.Municipal water sources can contain impurities that affect the taste and quality of your water.

The municipal water supply in these regions may contain trace amounts of contaminants such as chlorine, lead, pesticides, PFAS, microplastics and pharmaceuticals. In a world where people strive to eat properly, to exercise and live a healthy lifestyle, drinking unfiltered tap water may not be in line with these choices. A water filter from Watermart can effectively remove these substances from drinking water and give you peace of mind.Your choice depends on your preferences. Watermart Reverse Osmosis Systems are popular because they effectively remove contaminants from drinking water, including heavy metals, salts, and inorganic compounds like arsenic and cyanide. The process uses a semi-permeable membrane and pressure, along with carbon filters for chlorine, chloramines, and organic compounds like pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Some people add a remineralization filter for alkaline pH.On the other hand, many people prefer keeping the minerals and opt for a Watermart Multi-Stage Filtration System, which is similar to reverse osmosis but without the membrane. It uses sediment filtration and carbon adsorption to address most of the same contaminants while preserving minerals.Having a water filtration system installed can offer a range of advantages, including better taste and clarity of the water you consume on a daily basis, as well as reducing long-term exposure to small levels of harmful substances. These substances may include chlorine, ammonia, aluminum, and even trace amounts of pesticides, herbicides, hormones, and pharmaceuticals. Considering that people nowadays strive to eat healthily and lead a healthy lifestyle, it seems counterproductive to be exposed to such chemicals over the long term.Watermart Toronto water filtering systems can remove many contaminants, including chemicals like chlorine, chloramines, lead, aluminum, pesticides, herbicides, hormones, pharmaceuticals and a whole host of other pollutants. They can also reduce sediment levels or particles in the water that adversely affect its taste or smell.The cost of installing a home water filtration system Toronto depends on several factors such as the type of filter used (e.g., reverse osmosis or activated carbon), number of stages necessary for effective filtration (e.g., sediment prefilter), installation fees (if any) etc. Generally speaking, though, costs start around $300.00 for basic under-sink systems going up to about $3000.00 for highly sophisticated whole-house filtration systems.The average cost for a high quality under-sink home filtration system is usually in the range between $400-$700 depending on the type of filter used (e.g., reverse osmosis or activated carbon) as well as additional features required (e.g., pH balancing). More complex whole-house Toronto water filtration systems typically cost between $900 to $1800 depending on the size of the house/apartment and additional features included within the system (e.g., sediment prefilter).276 Carlaw Avenue, unit 301Toronto, ON  M4M 3L1  Canada.Mon-Thurs: 9am – 6pmFri: 9am – 5pm.Leave your contact info, and our experts will call to assist you.",

        "landingPageText": "Black Friday Sale15% Off Everything.Hurry Ends Nov 30th….Our most popular product – Because it’s scientifically proven – For camper’s that research well and buy from a trusted, certified business that cares about bringing the caravan industry the latest in water purification, science and facts.It is entirely a personal choice and up to you. Water quality around Australia can be variable and not always consistently treated to municipal water  treatment standards.  With the increase in the shear number of people camping, over development of our rural areas and increased runoff from increased flooding events, pollution levels in natural environments have been gradually becomming higher. This is why water filters are invaluable for anyone living or travelling in a caravan or RV, regardless of whether you are staying for a while in a caravan park, travelling from town to town, or you’re going off road and exploring the outback. A caravan water filter is invaluable for those travelling with young children. Why? Children’s immune systems are not fully developed when they are born and typically their immune systems only become fully developed around age 7-8.A caravan water filter needs to be the right type of filter for the job. And, water purification isn’t a simple “silver bullet”. And, if you want a cheap simple filter just to fill you van tanks then we are not the company for you. To provide safe drinking water caravan water filters need to be both effective as a purifier and compact, light weight, and technologically advanced. The Thirsty Nomad system will enable you to access and use, with confidence, mineralised bore water. With our 12 Volt portable purifier kit, you can purify free flowing water from rivers, creeks and streams. Our specialist range of products feature a Bore Water & 1 micron Sediment Pre-Filter which enables you to safely fill your tanks with bore water, along with a 5 in 1 purifier that can be installed in your caravan or RV to purify the water you use for drinking or cooking.It is not uncommon in rural Australian caravan parks to be accessing water from a local potable bore water source. While it can be of high quality, if it is properly maintained, groundwater can nevertheless be susceptible to a variety of contaminants, such as industrial pollution, radioactive materials, animal waste or more.It is important to understand that those outdated, generic, overpriced Granular Activated Carbon filters (GAC) will mineralise with bore water and do not filter bore water sufficiently for it to be used to fill your tanks with confidence. GAC filters cannot effectively remove sediment, silt, rust and dust – a sediment filter can.  A GAC is not a Stage 1 filter, a sediment pre-filter is. Additionally, CAG filterswill remove the chlorine that you may be provided with, this is wrong, as the chlorine going into your tanks is actually useful as a means of keeping your RV water tanks clean and safe. CAG filters cannot kill bacteria and viruses, nor can silver in a point of use water filter, without very long contact times.In contrast, the Thirsty Nomad 1 micron Bore Water and Sediment Pre-Filter is designed specifically to reduce the amount of calcium, magnesium and iron, as well as reduce sediment, silt and dust in bore water. All of which can cause a bio film to form in your tank and provide a perfect breeding ground for harmful pathogens.Our 1 micron bore water & sediment pre-filter should be combined with the Thirsty Nomad 5 in 1 Caravan Water Filter & Purifier, designed to produce safe, clean drinking and cooking water for your van. Our 5 in 1 Caravan Water Purifier is engineered, tested, and proven to international and Autralian Standards. The only inline water filter that purifies thanks to the Thirsty Nomad’s0.001 micron Quantum Disinfection media – providing you with the elimination of 99.9999% of harmful pathogens upon contact.To answer this question depends on water quality, water volume and filter type. Filters and purifiers are designed to ‘load’ over time, this means they are doing what they are designed to do. No quality water filter will last forever — you will find that any such claim in reality can’t be backed up — however, we want you to get the maxium life out of your Thirsty Nomad “5 in 1”. To get this longevity, we recommend you use your Thirsty Nomad as a dedicated drinking water purifier on a dedicated drinking water line in conjunction with our Bore Water & Sediment pre-filter.The carbon particles used in our 5 Micron Carbon Fibre Block technology are between 5 and 20 times smaller than in those outdated GAC filters. The fibres in our Carbon Fibre Block are much more tightly packed, so that even the smallest particles and contaminants are unable to get through (this also means it can continue to remove high levels of chlorine throughout it’s whole operating life).You can expect our 5 in 1 Caravan Water Filter & Purifier to effectively filter 7,500 lites of water before it needs to be changed (determined by volume and water quality). It is also possible to backwash your purifier.One of the best ways of ensuring that you get maximum operating life and efficiency from your inline water filter for caravan or RV is to make sure you have the right filter for the right job.That’s why we always recommend that you pair our 5 in 1 purifier with our Bore Water & Sediment Pre-filter. Giving you a 7 stage filtration system in 2 filters.Our Bore Water & 1 micron Sediment Pre-filter cartridges will last for approximately 3,500 litres, please note, this too is dependent on water quality and the level of dissolved minerals within the bore water. By using the pre-filter, this will not only protect your purifier so that the purifier lasts longer, but it will also help to protect the appliances in your camper or van from scale, algae, rust, dirt and sediment.If you use our pre-filter to fill and our purifier to purify at the tap, you can expect your purifier to be able to last even longer than the 7,500 litres (depending on the quality of water it is filtering).When the water flow rate inside of your van starts to show signs of slowing, this is the indicating factor that tells you that it’s time to change your filter.It is a straightforward procedure to install our ‘5 in 1 purifier inline  into your caravan or RV.The Thirsty Nomad 5 in 1 Purifier should be installed after a 55psi pump (the pressure helps the purifier to perform at optimum level) in either a 16 mm PEX, 12 mm, 8 mm or 6 mm cold water line (ideally a dedicated drinking water line), as this will give you longer operating life. The purifier can be mounted in either a horizontal or vertical position, and if installed after a 55psi pump, you can expect a flow rate of 4-6 litres per minute. We note that some caravan manufacturers are installing pumps that are lower than 55psi – our purifier will work with as low as 40psi pumps but the water flow rate will drop.To make installation easier for you, the 5 in 1 permanent option comes complete with simple push fittings that mean it is the work of a moment to connect, including:.The 2 x 1/2″ BSP male nylon fittings will fit most standard connections, including braided hoses with two female ends.The Thirsty Nomad 5 in 1 Caravan Water Filter is also a Caravan Water Purifier. Our exclusive Quantum Disinfection™ media, has been independently certified by over 14 laboratories to kill 99.9999% of bacteria, viruses in line with Australian Drinking Water Guidelines for e.Coli. Our purifier has been independently tested to Australian Water Microbiology testing standards to achieve “zero” e.Coli content.Additionally, our caravan water filter meets the internationally recognised NSF P231 Protocol for water disinfection. Designed in Australia by Australians, the Thirsty Nomad has an International Process Patent lodged with IP Australia.Our exclusive Quantum Disinfection™ media is odourless, high purity and environmentally friendly, as it is a solid ceramic, alumina based insoluble activated media. It is able to eliminate 99.9999% of pathogens within 0.1/second via a catalytic reaction and does not leach anything into the water. Quantum Disinfection media is 0.01 micron equivalent rated.This is 100 times finer than any other inline caravan water filter system on the market, and is why it is able to purify water so effectively.Yes, you can buy each the filters separately. You do not have to buy the Complete Kit – you can buy the Bore Water &  Sediment pre-filter seperately and you can also buy our 5 in 1 purifier seperately but we always highly recommend that our customers use the two filters as designed for the most opimal water treatment experience.Do you have more questions?Contact Us.Toll free:1800 979 752sales@thethirstynomad.com.auaccounts@thethirstynomad.com.au",
